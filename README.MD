## Risk Categories
The table below and it's corresponding data was taken from the website of [American Heart Association][1] and can be found on the following [page][2].

|BLOOD PRESSURE CATEGORY                    |	SYSTOLIC mm Hg (upper number) |	and/or           | DIASTOLIC mm Hg (lower number)|
| ----------------------------------------- | :-----------------------------: | :--------------: | :---------------------------: |
|NORMAL                                     |	LESS THAN 120                 |	and	             | LESS THAN 80                  |
|ELEVATED                                   |	120 – 129                     |	and	             | LESS THAN 80                  |
|HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE (HYPERTENSION) STAGE 1 |	130 – 139                     |	or               | 80 – 89                       |
|HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE (HYPERTENSION) STAGE 2 |	140 OR HIGHER                 |	or               |	90 OR HIGHER                 |
|HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS                        |	HIGHER THAN 180               |	and/or           |	HIGHER THAN 120              |

A difference of 30 mmHg in blood pressure readings between the arms, especially in the systolic (top number) reading, is generally considered a significant and concerning finding. While small differences are common and normal, a difference exceeding 10 mmHg, particularly 15 mmHg or more, is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular problems and mortality.
- **Normal Inter-arm Difference**:
A difference of 10 mmHg or less in systolic blood pressure between the arms is generally considered normal.
- **Concerning Difference**:
A difference of 10-15 mmHg or more in systolic pressure between the arms is more concerning and may be an early sign of vascular disease.
- **Significant Difference**:
A difference of 30 mmHg or more is a strong indicator of potential problems and warrants further investigation.


## Pulse Pressure
Pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressures. [3]

`Pulse Pressure = Systolic Blood Pressure – Diastolic Blood Pressure`

## Base Rules
These is a very generalized set of guidelines used to diagnose numerous conditions such as the development of heart disease, .

- A normal pulse pressure is typically around 40 mmHg.
- A pulse pressure of less than 40 mmHg may indicate aortic stenosis or other heart conditions.
- A pulse pressure that is less than 25% of the systolic pressure is inappropriately low or narrowed
- A pulse pressure of 60 mmHg or more is considered high and may indicate an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
- A pulse pressure of greater than 100 is high or widened.

### Risk Factors
- As little as a 10 mmHg increase in the pulse pressure increases the cardiovascular risk by as much as 20%
- Pulse pressure is also independently associated with an increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation. A study done by Mitchell et al. showed that patients with a pulse pressure of 40 mmHg or less developed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 5.6%, whereas patients with a pulse pressure greater than 61 mmHg developed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 23.3%.
- For every 20 mmHg increase in pulse pressure, the adjusted hazard ratio for developing atrial fibrillation is 1.28
- Narrowed pulse pressures are seen in dysautonomia/postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Some patients drop to pulse pressure to 0 on standing. They are pulseless standing and many cannot stand which causes extremely high morbidity. Conventional non-prescription measures fail most of these patients.

## General Definitions

**Arterial Pressure**, which is the average blood pressure that a patient experiences in a single cardiac cycle.

**Cardiac Cycle** - A single cardiac cycle represents one complete heartbeat, encompassing the contraction (systole) and relaxation (diastole) of both the atria and ventricles. It's essentially the sequence of events that occur from the beginning of one heartbeat to the start of the next.

**Arterial compliance** refers to the ability of an artery's wall to expand and accommodate a change in volume and pressure. It is the opposite of Arterial Stiffness.

**Aortic Stenosis** is a condition where the aortic valve, which controls blood flow from the heart to the body's main artery, becomes narrowed or stiff, restricting blood flow. This narrowing, also known as stenosis, makes it harder for the heart to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.
